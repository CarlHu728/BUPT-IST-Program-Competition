Two integers $n$, $m$, representing the number of lanterns and the number of connections in the pattern, where the prayer seat with a magatama count of $1$ is seat number $1$. ($2 \le n \le 10^5$, $1 \le m \le \min {\{\dfrac{n(n - 1)}{2}, 10^5\}}$)

The following $m$ lines, each containing two integers $u$, $v$, indicate that $u$ is connected to $v$. ($1 \le u < v \le n$)
