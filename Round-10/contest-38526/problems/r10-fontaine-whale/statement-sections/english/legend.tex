Fontaine has a prophecy that reads roughly as follows: the water levels in Fontaine will rise, and all the people with sin will be drowned and dissolved, with only the Hydro Archon, Furina, remaining, weeping on her throne.

Now we know that all of this is due to a huge narwhal in Primordial Sea, All-Devouring Narwhal. When it is big enough, it will cause the Primordial Sea water to leak.

Focalors has mastered the function $f(t)$ of the All-Devouring Narwhal's size changing with time, and the minimum size $k$ that causes the water of Primordial Sea water to leak.

Now it is known that $f(t)$ is a strictly increasing and differentiable function, and the function value at some point in $(0, 100)$ is equal to $k$. However, Focalors does not master the closed form of the function. She can only calculate $f(t)$ based on a certain $t$, and cannot derive or do other operations.
