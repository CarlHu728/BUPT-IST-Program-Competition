In Genshin Impact, the protagonist Traveler excels at using teleport waypoints for fast travel. Specifically, the Traveler can teleport from any location to the designated teleport waypoint.

In the Huaguang Stone Forest of Liyue, there are several extremely high peaks that are nearly impossible to climb, connected by wooden bridges. Among these peaks, only one has a teleport waypoint.

Recently, the Traveler received a commission to inspect these bridges. In order to minimize the inspection time, the Traveler hopes to find a path that \textbf{starts from the teleport waypoint}, passes through each bridge exactly once, and can \textbf{end at any peak}.

Your task is to determine whether the path the Traveler is looking for exists.
