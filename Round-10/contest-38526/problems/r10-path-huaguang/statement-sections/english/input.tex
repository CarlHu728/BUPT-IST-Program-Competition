The first line consists of two integers, $n$ and $m$, representing the number of peaks and the number of bridges. The peak with the teleport waypoint is designated as peak $1$. ($3 \le n \le 200$ï¼Œ$2 \le m \le \dfrac{n(n - 1)}{2}$)

The following $m$ lines each contain two integers, $u$ and $v$, indicating a bridge connecting peaks $u$ and $v$. ($1 \le u < v \le n$)

It is guaranteed that any peak can be reached from the teleport waypoint, and there is no pair of bridges connecting the same pair of peaks.
