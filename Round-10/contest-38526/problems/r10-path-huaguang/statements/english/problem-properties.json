Specifically, the Traveler can teleport from any location to the designated teleport waypoint.\r\n\r\nIn the Huaguang Stone Forest of Liyue, there are several extremely high peaks that are nearly impossible to climb, connected by wooden bridges. Among these peaks, only one has a teleport waypoint.\r\n\r\n\\begin{center}\r\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{path.jpg} \\\\\r\n  \\small{Huaguang Stone Forest}\r\n\\end{center}\r\n\r\nRecently, the Traveler received a commission to inspect these bridges. In order to minimize the inspection time, the Traveler hopes to find a path that \\textbf{starts from the teleport waypoint}, passes through each bridge exactly once, and can \\textbf{end at any peak}.\r\n\r\nYour task is to determine whether the path the Traveler is looking for exists.","authorLogin":"CaveNightingale","language":"english","timeLimit":1000,"output":"If the path exists, output ``YES''; otherwise, output ``NO''.
